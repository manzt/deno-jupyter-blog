    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks have become the de facto standard for interactive computing\n",
    "and data analysis, combining code, prose, and visualizations in a single\n",
    "document.\n",
    "\n",
    "This blog post was written in a notebook!\n",
    "\n",
    "Since v1.37, Deno has included a built-in Jupyter kernel, bringing JavaScript\n",
    "and TypeScript to data science and machine learning. Having worked extensively\n",
    "with computational notebooks (mainly in Python), I find this exciting for\n",
    "several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Easier setup** – The kernel is built into the Deno CLI, so there’s no need\n",
    "  for additional installation. Just install Deno.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Improved dependency management** – Notebooks often behave like standalone\n",
    "  scripts, making dependency management a challenge in other languages and\n",
    "  contributing to\n",
    "  [reproducibility issues](https://leomurta.github.io/papers/pimentel2019a.pdf).\n",
    "  Deno's use of ECMAScript modules allows dependencies to be declared directly\n",
    "  in code, improving self-containment and reliability of analysis code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A unified ecosystem for interactive data analysis** – Jupyter frontends rely\n",
    "  on web technologies and support rich outputs in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The\n",
    "  JavaScript ecosystem is mature and among the most accessible for UI\n",
    "  development, and Deno bridges the gap between the kernel and front end,\n",
    "  unlocking new possibilities for data science and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, we'll analyze the National Gallery of Art's Open Access data in\n",
    "Jupyter with Deno. We'll start with basic data cleaning, manipulation, and\n",
    "plotting to explore which artworks are public domain, who created them, where\n",
    "they're from, and any interesting patterns. The techniques should feel familiar\n",
    "to those who've worked in Jupyter before, but we'll introduce some of the key\n",
    "libraries available for working with data in Deno (e.g., `npm:nodejs-polars`,\n",
    "`npm:@observablehq/plot`). Finally, we'll integrate interactive widgets and\n",
    "extend Jupyter with a custom display to make exploring the data more dynamic and\n",

    "The **National Gallery of Art (NGA)\n",
    "[Open Data Program](https://www.nga.gov/open-access-images/open-data.html)**\n",

    "[on GitHub](https://github.com/NationalGalleryOfArt/opendata/tree/main/data).\n",
    "This dataset includes valuable metadata such as titles, dates, artists, and\n",

    "[Creative Commons 0 (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/)\n",
    "license, meaning it's free to use and share.\n",
    "\n",

    "by famous artists like Mary Cassatt, M.C. Escher, Vincent van Gogh, Pablo\n",
    "Picasso, and Georgia O'Keeffe.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, navigating this resource is challenging. The National Gallery's website\n",
    "is not very user-friendly, making it difficult to make sense of what is actually\n",
    "_in_ the dataset. It's nearly impossible to get any high-level insights, like\n",
    "the number of paintings, which time periods are most represented, or which\n",
    "artists are most prevalent–let alone make specific queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, the dataset is available\n",
    "[on GitHub](https://github.com/NationalGalleryOfArt/opendata/tree/main/data) as\n",
    "a collection of related tables, exported as CSV files. For our analysis, we'll\n",

    "\n",
    "- **`objects.csv`** – Metadata about artworks, including titles, dates,\n",
    "  materials, and classifications.\n",
    "- **`constituents.csv`** – Artist details such as names, nationalities, and\n",
    "  lifespans.\n",
    "- **`published_images.csv`** – Links to artwork images via the NGA’s IIIF API.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll **clean** and **join** these tables to create a **unified dataset**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**But wait!** While these NGA tables are free to use, they only includes\n",
    "_metadata_. The actual artwork images have separate licensing, with only about\n",
    "half being CC0-licensed. We'll gather this info separately to identify freely\n",
    "available images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to unify the data to identify public domain images, explore subsets,\n",
    "and view available artworks. Maybe you'll even find an upgrade for that default\n",
